# tech-tips-and-resources
Tech tips and remarks I collect over my working and learning experience and chose to share it on-purpose.

They are a mix of new and well-known remarks but I preferred to document them because you know, at the end of the day, we, software engineers, always need this refreshment.

## Contributions:
I truely appreciate feedback, so if you find anything that needs revision or new thing that you think it will be helpful for sharing go ahead and open a PR :wink:
