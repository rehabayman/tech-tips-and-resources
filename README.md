# tech-tips-and-resources
Tech tips and remarks I collect over my working and learning experience and chose to share it on-purpose.

They are a mix of new and well-known remarks but I preferred to document them because you know, at the end of the day, we, software engineers, always need this refreshment.

## Table of Contents:

1. Remarks on tech topics: [remarks.md](https://github.com/rehabayman/tech-tips-and-resources/blob/master/remarks.md)
2. Remarks on tech tools: [tools.md](https://github.com/rehabayman/tech-tips-and-resources/blob/master/tools.md)
